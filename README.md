# Machine Learning

A repository that contains my machine learning knowledge acquired through the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & Tensorflow" written by [AurÃ©lion GÃ©ron](https://github.com/ageron).

Here in this repository, you'll follow me on my journey reading this book and extracting all the possible knowledge.

let's enjoy this journey ðŸš€âœ¨.
